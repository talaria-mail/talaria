# Encryption

Talaria is built with privacy and security as a forethought. This document
describes the encryption systems in place. All users have a Curve25519 key-pair
generated on creation

```golang
type User struct {
    // Other fields elided
    

    ContentKey struct {
        Public []byte   // 32 byte Curve25519 public key
        Private []byte  // 32 byte encrypted Curve25519 private key
    }
}
```

All inbound message for this user are encrypted using the public key. The
public key encryption uses [ECIES][eceis] where `chacha20poly1305` is its
AEAD (we use the extended nonce version of chacha20 called xchacha20).

The private key, which can be used to decrypt this message, is stored
encrypted. That private key can only be decrypted with a key generated from
the user password. When a user signs in we exchange their password for this
decryption key and recover the content private key. This means message are
decrypted only for authenticated users.

## Key-value store

Since all data storage is done with the key-value store, we can realize
data encryption by adding it as a middleware in the key-value store. We store
public keys in the context for `Put` calls to encrypt data,

```golang
ctx := context.Background()
ctx = encryption.WithKey(ctx, pubkey)

store := kv.NewStore()
store = encryption.KVMiddleware{
    Next: store,
}

err := store.Put(ctx, `key`, []byte(`value`)) // value will be encrypted
```

Conversely, we must add the private key for `Get` and `Delete` calls. We add
the pivate key for `Delete` calls because we want deletion to be authenicated.

```golang
ctx = encryption.WithKey(ctx, privkey)

value, err = store.Get(ctx, `key`)
```
